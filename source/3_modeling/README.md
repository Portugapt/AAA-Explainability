# Modeling

In this phase, we train our models.  
They are saved in pickle files in the artifacts folder.   


We did an implementation of https://github.com/aganse/docker_mlflow_db (docker_mlflow_db) to work with Jupyter-lab (any Stack avaliable or custom made), the PostgreSQL docker image, and MLFlow.  

MLFlow is available at: http://localhost:5000 
Jupyter-Lab is avaliable at: http://localhost:8888 (Please see how to setup a jupyter token, I go into the container logs to checkout the link.)
